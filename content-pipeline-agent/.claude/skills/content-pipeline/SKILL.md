# Content Pipeline Best Practices

## Extraction
- Remove navigation, das, footers
- Preserve semantic structure (paragraphs, lists)
- Keep metadata when relevant

## Summarization
- Bullets: 5-10 items, one concept each
- Executive: 3-5 sentences, key decisions
- Preserve critical facts

## Quality Checks
- Verify no HTML tags remain after extraction
- Ensure summary is shorter than original
- Check key points are factually grounded
